# DONE SO FAR:
1. Dropped certain features
2. Converted time data to pd.datetime objects
3. One hot encoded categorical variables (for ML model)
4. started feature engineering (created 'weekend' column which has good correlation with target variable)

# NEXT STEPS:
1. dealing with missing data: see which columns have data missing, choose whether to keep the columns and impute missing values or drop columns
2. dealing with outliers
3. feature engineering: explore how we can combine features or make new features which have a higher correlation with the target variable, right now only the Distance(KM) feature has high correlation with the target variable
